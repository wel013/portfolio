    <h1>Project 5: Code Generation for uC Language in C++
    </h1>
    <h5>uC language is a language developped by the professcor of this class for the use in this class.</h5>
    <hr class="left-aligned-hr">
    <div>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <hr class="left-aligned-hr">

        <p>The focus of this project was to implement a code generator for the uC language, a small language within the
            C family,
            to generate C++ code. The primary goals were to grasp metaprogramming concepts, understand language
            translation
            processes, and gain proficiency in using macros and templates. Additionally, it aimed to provide experience
            in working
            with a complex codebase, particularly dealing with code written by someone else.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Key Components</h4>
        <hr class="left-aligned-hr">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Phase 1: Generating Type Declarations: The initial step involved generating forward declarations for
                user-defined types
                and functions in order to support usage before definition, adhering to the semantics of uC.
                Prioritization was given to
                forward declarations of types preceding those of functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Phase 2: Generating Function Declarations: This phase focused on generating forward declarations
                specifically for
                user-defined functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Phase 3: Generating Type Definitions: Following the order constraints in C++, this phase concentrated on
                generating full
                definitions for each user-defined type. This ensured that the type contents were accessible before
                function definitions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Phase 4: Generating Function Definitions: Subsequently, full definitions for each user-defined function
                were generated,
                marking the completion of the code generation process for function implementations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Phase 5: Polymorphic Operations: The final phase aimed to implement operations involving polymorphism,
                specifically the
                addition of two items. Due to the absence of type computation from a prior project, reliance was placed
                on the target
                C++ compiler to resolve these operations.
