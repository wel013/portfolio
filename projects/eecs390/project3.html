    <h1>Project 3: Scheme Metacircular Evaluator
    </h1>
    <hr class="left-aligned-hr">
    <div>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <hr class="left-aligned-hr">

        <p>This project involved crafting an interpreter for a subset of the R5RS Scheme programming language entirely
            in Scheme
            itself. The primary objectives were to deepen proficiency in functional programming, including recursion,
            higher-order
            functions, functional data abstraction, and message passing. Additionally, the project aimed to elucidate
            the principles
            of interpretation and distinguish between static and dynamic scope in programming languages.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Key Components</h4>
        <hr class="left-aligned-hr">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Phase 1: Dictionaries and Environments: The initial phase centered on constructing abstract data types
                for dictionaries
                and environments using higher-order functions. The focus was on message passing and dispatch functions,
                utilizing Scheme
                symbols as messages.
            </li>
            <li>
                Phase 2: Primitives and Evaluation: Implemented fundamental aspects of the Scheme interpreter, enabling
                the evaluation
                of basic Scheme expressions. This phase empowered the interpreter to handle simple expressions involving
                calls to
                primitive procedures and compound expressions composed of these foundational elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Phase 3: Special Forms: Extended the evaluation procedure in the interpreter to accommodate special
                forms. These forms
                differ from procedures by expecting unevaluated arguments, treating them as data instead of directly
                evaluating them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Phase 4: Dynamic Scope: Introduced an extension to the Scheme language by incorporating a "mu" form that
                generates
                procedures utilizing dynamic scope instead of static scope. Dynamic scope with shallow binding was
                emphasized, altering
                the parent environment of newly created frames for procedure calls.
            </li>
            <li>
                Developed an exhaustive set of test cases to rigorously evaluate the functionality and correctness of
                the interpreter.
                These tests encompassed various scenarios, ensuring the interpreter handled different expressions and
                special forms
                accurately.
            </li>
