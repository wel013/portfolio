    <h1>Project 3: Simulation of Euchre Card Game
    </h1>
    <hr class="left-aligned-hr">
    <div>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <hr class="left-aligned-hr">

        <p>Building an image resizing program utilizing a seam-carving algorithm.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Key Components</h4>
        <hr class="left-aligned-hr">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Card:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Developed an Abstract Data Type (ADT) for a playing card, representing the rank and suit of a
                        card. The Card ADT
                        included overloaded operators for performing comparisons between different card types, enhancing
                        flexibility within the
                        game.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Pack:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Implemented an ADT that represents a pack of playing cards. The default Pack constructor
                        initialized a full
                        pack with cards arranged
                        from lowest to highest. Additionally, a secondary Pack constructor was designed to read a pack
                        from stream input,
                        allowing for increased versatility in pack initialization.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Player:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Implemented two player types: a Simple AI player and a Human-controlled player. Players were
                        created using dynamically
                        allocated memory, employing a factory function that returned a pointer to a Player with the
                        correct dynamic type. Each
                        player class is derived from the Player abstract base class and provided overrides for each
                        player function. These
                        functions, including making trumps, adding and discarding cards, and playing tricks. SImple AI
                        player adhered to a
                        rule-based approach. The Human Player interacted with human input.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Driver Interface:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Developed a driver interface enabling users to run the Euchre game. This interface served as the
                        entry point for
                        executing the game simulation, providing an intuitive way for users to engage with and observe
                        the game's progression.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
