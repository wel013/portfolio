In this branch I will try to build a drop down 
system for filtering projects based on the tags
1. build a page that randomly displays 4 projects
so that the page does not look too empty
2. build a search bar/drop down to filter out the
projects, once the search result returns, display those
projects

8/2 
displayed the fetched projects property
