In diff-project I want to try to put projects: 
projects should have three levels of page, the first one shows all the courses (from all three category)
and this course page should have a drop down bar to help filter which category youcan see

click into each course, there are all the projects

click into each indiv project

##########################################
also when add a project, the course section should be a drop down menu for use to select from all the avaliable courses that they have entered
which means you can only create a course ifyou created a course 
also i can leave a special index for self projects that does not come from any projects (like tthe personal ones)
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

my project form is not working correctly due to i want to have a drop down to selece courses but the imports are not working right (âœ…)

7/30 
tentative organization idea
Self Project(three categories) -> list of all the courses in that category-> List all the projects -> indiv projects

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Future: 
need to add a form a insert project/courses; and make sure to not mess up the relationships in the db
make sure only me (admin) who can log in and then to create project/course entries (other people only view)
